Overview
========

macdestroyer is a simple package that attempts to render the target machine unbootable. It works best with FileVault 2 encrypted volumes.

As OS X 10.9+ removed the ability to add a user to FileVault without providing a password or recovery key, the package includes
a tiny utility to add users to the FileVault2-enabled users list. This relies on what is probably a bug in libodfde and so will probably
break in future versions of OS X. This has been tested on 10.9-10.11.3

Mechanisms
----------

If the machine's local disk is FV2-encrypted:

1. Adds a new user called `fde_locked_user` with a random password
2. Adds this user to the list of users who can unlock the disk
3. Removes all other users
4. Shuts down the machine


Otherwise for pre-10.11:

1. Renames `launchd` to `launchd_disabled`
2. Shuts down the machine


The encrypted case is best when using some sort of FileVault key escrow mechanism, like [Cauliflower Vest](https://github.com/google/cauliflowervest), as this allows for recovery of the disk's data for, e.g., legal discovery.

The non-FV2 case is, obviously, merely an annoyance to anyone knowledgeable with OS X and doesn't work at all for 10.11, which prevents modification to /sbin/launchd.

Customization
-------------

In the `postflight`, the `LOCK_USER_NAME` and `LOCK_USER_HINT` could be informative:
`LOCK_USER_HINT="Contact Helpdesk"`

The included `Makefile` is a simple [luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage) recipe. You'll have to update the `LUGGAGE` variable to point to the location of `luggage.make` in your build environment.
